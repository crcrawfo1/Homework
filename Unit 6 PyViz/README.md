# Pyviz Panel Dashboard
> Coded by Connor Crawford
>> Contains two notebooks, one the original code for the dashboard plots, and one the dashboard itself. Each runs independently of the other.

This dashboard is designed to allow you to determine the most ideal neighborhood for you economically speaking when considering moving to San Francisco in the year 2017. The first tab contains a map with the location of the various neighborhoods with some simple information. The second tab breaks down the volume of housing units sold between 2010 and 2016, then provides a plot with a dropdown selector for each of the different neighborhoods providing information about the average price per square foot within that neighborhood between 2010 and 2016. Another tab forward, and you will find the average price per square foot graphed next to the average rental price of all of SF from 2010 to 2016. This is designed to help you determine if renting or buying is the better solution. If you check out the final tab, you will find the 10 most expensive neighborhoods with a bar chart describing the average sale price per square foot in each neighborhood between 2010 and 2016. If you scroll down you will find a parallel coordinates plot and a parallel categories plot that each provide more information about these 10 neighborhoods. Happy hunting!
