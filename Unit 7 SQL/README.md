# Fraudulent Activity SQL Assignment
### Coded by Connor Crawford

You will find two SQL Files, one titled schema, which is the query I used to create my tables, and one titled Query, which is the query I used to create the views necessary to answer the questions. The data you will need for this assignment to work is in the data folder. You will need to link the csvs to the tables the schema query creates. Additionally, there is a jupyter notebook that fulfills the python-based requirements of this assignment.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :)
