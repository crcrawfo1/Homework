# Time Series Homework
> Coded by Connor Crawford

In this homework I've tested the many time-series tools that I've learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. Dollar.

There are two Jupyter Lab notebooks and one csv containing information about the Yen. Both notebooks run independently and satisfy the requirements of the Unit 10 Homework Assignment.
