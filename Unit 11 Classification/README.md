# Unit 11 Classification Homework
> Coded by Connor Crawford

### A Quick Blurb:

In this assignment, I was tasked with building and evaluationg several machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub. I used ensemble learning and resampling to accomplish this goal.

### How this repository works:

In the notebooks folder, you will find two working notebooks that satisfy the requirements of the unit 11 classification homework. In the resources folder you will find a blank csv. That was included just in order to allow github to create a resources folder. In order for the code to work, you will need to drop the 'LoanStats_2019Q1.csv' file shared with us via slack into the resources folder.
