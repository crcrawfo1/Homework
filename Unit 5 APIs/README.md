# Unit 5 APIs
### Author: Connor Crawford
In this code, I've used api's to retrieve data about prices for various stocks, and cryptos. I then used that data to analyze a savings portfolio, and then run Monte Carlo Simulations to project the performance of the portfolio over the next 5, 10 and 30 years.

## In order for this code to run, you will need to have a .env file in the same folder as the code that contains an alpaca api key and an alpaca secret key.
