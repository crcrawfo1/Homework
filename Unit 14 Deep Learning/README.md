# Unit 14 Deep Learning Homework
Coded by Connor Crawford

This folder satisfies the requirements of the Unit 14 Deep Learning Homework. There are two notebooks that each predict the prices of bitcoing using either recent stock data or recent FNG data. The recent stock data proved to be a more accurate indicator based on this model. There is a summary at the bottom of both notebooks that describes my findings.
